Should an Object2D necessarily be a Drawable? I feel like an Object2D just provides object characteristics and 
Drawable provides drawable characteristics and if somethign has both it can derive from both 

Might not be bad to even separate SDL stuff into its own class -- if an object is going to be rendered
as an SDL rect, it should inherit and access rect that way so that e.g. the Jumper class is completely separated
from anything SDL related. Could be more easily reusable that way
    But I guess it's just the Draw() function that changes and that's abstract in the first place in order to 
    allow for each class to implement it its own way anways

Figure out how people normall implement simple motion/jumps and things like that. It seems like there would be an 
elegant way to program a little physics and let that take care of motion with some initiation from user actions... 
Right now I am having to like only let physics affect things when the object is in the air by overriding the generic
object updateMotion with a jumper update motion... and I will have to do the same with obstacles... 
    I guess this allows everything to be affected a little differently... 

It would probably be useful to create a GameManager or something like that to let you switch between pre-, mid-, and post-game screens
and allow for more structured configuration, and also manage game state a little bit better
    - GameManager exists generally and then individual games inherit from it
    - Could also have a general game driver type beat where the game is written and exposes a certain interface like start(), run(), menu(),
    exit()
        - May be difficult to make this both flexible and useful? Will take some thinking, and may not prove useful enough to go through with


Pain points 07/07/2024
    - Can jump over every obstacle so ducking does not come into play
        - Need duck obstacles to be larger height to disallow jumping over and still requiring duck
    - Static spawn time (combined with above) means you can just pretty regularly jump and things will be fine
        - Gradually lower spawn interval over time + decent variation in every spawn
    -
